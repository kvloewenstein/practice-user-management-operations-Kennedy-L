# SQL User Management Practice

In this practice, I applied my SQL skills to manage user data by inserting new records, updating existing users, deleting specific rows, and writing SELECT queries with conditions, sorting, 
and limits. I used a pre-populated table of 20 users to simulate real application data. The most challenging part was making sure updates and deletions affected the correct rows while maintaining data accuracy.
